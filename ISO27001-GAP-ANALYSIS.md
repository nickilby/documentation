- ISO 27001 is a management system standard, not just a checklist
- Policies must be **approved by management**
- Policies must be **communicated to all relevant personnel**
- Policies must be **reviewed regularly** (typically annually)
- **Evidence of implementation** is as important as the policies themselves
- Consider engaging an ISO 27001 consultant for gap analysis and certification support
