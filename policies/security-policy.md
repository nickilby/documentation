## Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for information security management to protect organizational assets, data, and systems from threats and vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This policy applies to all IT systems, networks, data, personnel, and third-party services that access or process organizational information.

## Policy Statement

All IT resources must be protected against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction. Security measures must be implemented in accordance with risk assessments and industry best practices.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

- Regular access reviews and revocation of unnecessary privileges

### 3. Separation of Duties

- Critical functions require multiple personnel
- No single individual has complete control
